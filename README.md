My Fitness Data: Data Science applied to my own fitness data

21/08/2023 - Beggining

- Gather all kinds of data that might be of interest from my wearable and smart scale.
- Started collecting my daily meals data
- Research for articles, papers about fitness data
- Continue to collect data from my wearable


Ideas to track and analyze:
- Sleep(stages, hour count, score, blood oxygen level), 
- Diet(Calorie intake, macronutrients, number of meals, estimated vs real calorie intake)
- Activity/steps(active hours, calories spent active, count of steps, exercise intensity)
- Heart data(stress, min-max rate, heart rate at rest)
- Insights for specific exercise in Running, cycling, gym(there's a good reference for cycling on towards data science!)
- Weight/body composition(weight, muscle weight, fat weight, percentage of fat, basal metabolic rate, circumferences)
- Location metrics(see if I can extract from google maps, track cities visited, time on each kind of transport, places that i went to the most, places i spent most time on)
- Look All together.

Group by day section (morning, afternoon, night); months; weekday; location(cities); impact moments (before and after
nutritional monitoring, before and after working, before and after going to the gym, before and after university)


Why self track?

Initially I wanted to see how I was doing on exercises during the pandemic, how fast I was cycling, running, etc. And out of curiosity too, see the stats of my fitness life always excited me, because it was the combination of two things that I love, analysing data and having a fitness life.
